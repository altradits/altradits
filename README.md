**We help people feel calmer, wiser, and more capable with money.**

</div>

Altradits is a personal wealth management operating system designed to make money feel calmer, clearer, and easier to manage. Instead of spreadsheets, stress, and confusion, Altradits helps users build better money behavior through reflection, gentle coaching, and intelligent organization.

Altradits is designed to feel like **a calm financial companion** — not a cold financial dashboard.

---

## Philosophy

> **"Did this make money feel easier today?"**

Money should feel calmer, clearer, less lonely, less scary, more hopeful, and easier to understand. Altradits exists to help people feel **calmer, wiser, and more capable with money**.

Every feature follows one core principle:

```
notice → reassure → assist → confirm
```

### Founder Principles

- Never shame. Never surprise. Never assume.
- Always ask consent.
- Reduce anxiety. Increase clarity.
- Protect future self. Help quietly.
- Human first. Trust over automation.

---

## Core Features

### Daily Money Capture
Fast, frictionless money entry. Supports chat input, todo lists, manual capture, and (future) SMS ingestion, voice, and sticky note OCR.

```
Fuel 2k
Lunch 350
Oak 5k
Send mum 2k
```

### Budgeting
Simple, customizable categories. Users create their own spending structure, track saving, and review daily behavior.

```
Food · Transport · Bills · Family · Grow Money · Fun · Emergency
```

### Bedtime Logoff Ritual
The heart of Altradits. At the end of every day:

```
review → reflect → learn → prepare tomorrow → close calmly
```

Goal: reduce financial anxiety before sleep.

### Affordability Guidance
Instead of YES / NO, Altradits explains comfort:

> This looks comfortable. Buying this may slow your laptop goal slightly.

### Financial Freedom Planning
Tracks when investment income can comfortably support life expenses. Shows spending, savings, investment growth, and freedom timeline in plain language.

### Companion System
A behavioral growth companion — Seed, Puppy, Kitten, or Tree — that grows based on consistency, reflection, saving, and planning. **Not based on wealth or income.**

### Investment Tracking
Tracks money market funds, treasury bills, bonds, stocks, ETFs, and personal investments in simple language.

### AI Financial Companion
Acts as guide, planner, teacher, coach, and protector. Never judgmental, pushy, manipulative, or shame-based.

## Revenue Model

Altradits earns because it helped — never through fear, confusion, or dark patterns.
